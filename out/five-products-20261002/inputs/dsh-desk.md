## From download to first task

1. Download the build for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/majiayu000/dsh-desk/releases).
2. Install and open DSH Desk. The pinned Harness runtime starts automatically.
3. Choose a model provider in the official Harness onboarding dialog and send your first task.

No system Node.js installation, npm setup, port selection, or terminal command is required.

> 📺 Video slot: a clean-machine, uncut download-to-first-task recording is the next launch gate and will be embedded here once published. Until then, “60 seconds” is a product target rather than a benchmark claim.

## Why this distribution exists

DeepSeek Harness already provides the agent runtime, web UI, sessions, tools, approvals, settings, and plugin protocol. DSH Desk does not fork those product surfaces. It owns the desktop responsibilities that should be boring and dependable:

- bundles Node 24 and the exact `@deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.5-rc.2` runtime;
- isolates state in a private `DSH_HOME` instead of modifying an existing CLI setup;
- waits for a real HTTP health check on the launch-token loopback URL;
- grants the remote Harness page no Tauri IPC, shell, or filesystem capability;
- constrains navigation to the exact runtime origin and opens external links in the system browser;
- supervises only the process group it started;
- checks the pinned version and the newest upstream candidate every day;
- reviews plugin source, integrity, lifecycle scripts, and rollback boundaries before installation.

## Current availability

| Platform | Latest published download | Signing status |
|---|---|---|
| macOS Apple Silicon & Intel | `v0.1.0-alpha.13` DMG (both architectures) | Developer ID signed, notarized, stapled |
| Windows x64 | `v0.1.0-alpha.13` NSIS installer | Unsigned alpha (SmartScreen notice); updater payloads independently signed |
| Linux x64 | `v0.1.0-alpha.13` AppImage & deb | Updater signatures included |

This repository now pins **DSH Desk `0.1.0-alpha.14`** with `@deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.5-rc.2`. That combination is what CI verifies. GitHub Releases still serve `v0.1.0-alpha.13` (`@deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.0-rc.6`) until the signed `v0.1.0-alpha.14` pipeline publishes. Windows alpha releases may be published without Authenticode and say so in their Release Notes. See the live [compatibility radar](https://majiayu000.github.io/dsh-desk/), [compatibility evidence](docs/compatibility.md), and individual [Actions runs](https://github.com/majiayu000/dsh-desk/actions) for the latest facts.

## What is different

| | Official Harness CLI | Typical desktop wrapper | DSH Desk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Runtime setup | User manages Node/npm | Varies; may resolve `latest` | Exact bundled runtime |
| Official UI | Yes | Sometimes modified | Unmodified |
| Desktop IPC from runtime page | Browser-only | Project-dependent | None |
| Upstream drift detection | User-managed | Project-dependent | Daily public checks |
| Failed update recovery | User-managed | Project-dependent | Signed updater contract and explicit recovery path |

DSH Desk does **not** claim to have the smallest installer. The offline runtime increases package size. “Lightweight” here means no bundled Chromium and no fork of the official product UI.

## Trusted plugin workflow

Open `DSH Desk → Plugins…` to inspect a plugin before installation:

- exact package, resolved version, source, and integrity;
- lifecycle scripts and declared file/network/command/credential needs;
- compatibility with the pinned Desktop and Harness versions;
- disable, removal, and profile restoration boundaries.

Catalog failure never falls back to an unreviewed global search. The Plugins window can open the community registry at [plugin.dshdesk.com](https://plugin.dshdesk.com/); copied `dsh plugin add` commands are parsed into the same review flow, and that site is not the trusted catalog. Plugin authors can use the [minimal template](templates/dsh-plugin/README.md), run the reusable [candidate compatibility check](docs/plugin-verification.md), and submit the verification form only after it passes.

## Compatibility is a release artifact

Every push and pull request tests macOS arm64, Windows x64, and Linux x64 for:

- TypeScript build and Rust checks/tests;
- real Harness startup, strict loopback URL, and HTTP readiness;
- an offline runtime that does not depend on system Node.js;
- plugin add/why/update/remove parity with the original CLI;
- onboarding and signed-updater contracts.

A scheduled workflow also installs the newest npm candidate in an isolated CI workspace. It reports drift without silently changing the runtime on user machines. Read the [public matrix](docs/compatibility.md) for evidence and precise definitions.

## Development

The development toolchain uses pnpm 12.3.4:

```sh
npx --yes pnpm@12.3.4 install
npx --yes pnpm@12.3.4 exec tauri dev
```

Run the complete local verification suite:

```sh
pnpm check
pnpm test:rust
pnpm test:harness-contract
pnpm test:onboarding-contract
pnpm prepare:runtime       # requires Node 24
pnpm test:packaged-runtime
pnpm test:plugin-parity
pnpm test:plugin-template
pnpm test:plugin-catalog
pnpm test:plugin-source
pnpm test:updater-contract
```

Set an initial workspace with `DSH_DESKTOP_WORKSPACE=/path/to/project`. Create a minimal plugin bundle with:

```sh
pnpm create:plugin ./my-dsh-plugin @your-scope/my-dsh-plugin
```
